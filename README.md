This project demonstrates a complete pipeline for automated image processing, feature extraction, clustering, and classification using state-of-the-art deep learning models along with advanced data clustering and analysis techniques. The modular structure of the program ensures that each task—segmentation, feature extraction, clustering, and classification—is handled individually yet complements the next stage seamlessly.
Key components of the project include:
1. **Image Segmentation**: Using a trained generator model (e.g., UNet-GAN) for high-quality image denoising and segmentation to prepare inputs for further processing.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Leveraging pre-trained EfficientNet models to extract representative features from images, ensuring that the critical characteristics of input data are well captured.
3. **Clustering and Visualization**: Applying clustering algorithms such as K-means to group similar images into distinct categories. The results are visualized using PCA for dimensionality reduction, combined with intuitive plotting methods for better interpretability.
4. **Classification**: Employing a fine-tuned VGG16 model for binary classification, enhancing the pipeline's ability to assign meaningful labels to individual images. The classification step also calculates prediction confidence, ensuring transparency and reliability.
5. **Confidence Analysis and Visualization**: The project includes confidence evaluation, with visualizations such as histograms and KDE plots to assess cluster quality and prediction robustness.
6. **Automated Workflow**: This pipeline moves images into corresponding folders based on their cluster labels, simplifying the management of categorized files. The entire process is robust, scalable, and well-suited to large-scale datasets.
